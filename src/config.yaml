      text: hHow do i get my newborn to sleep better?
    - user: HappyMama
      text: Newborns have a hard time sleeping through the night, and it can be difficult for parents to get their baby to sleep better. The best way to help your newborn sleep better is to establish a consistent bedtime routine. This should include a warm bath, a massage, a lullaby, and a feeding. It is also important to make sure that the baby's sleeping environment is comfortable and safe. Make sure the room is dark and quiet, and the temperature is comfortable. You can also use white noise to help your baby sleep better. Additionally, it is important to make sure that your baby is getting enough daytime sleep. During the day, make sure to provide your baby with plenty of opportunities for naps and rest. Finally, make sure to respond to your baby's cries quickly and consistently. This will help your baby learn to self-soothe and eventually sleep better.

      text: Can i eat raw papayas during pregnancy?
    - user: HappyMama
      text: Eating raw papayas during pregnancy is not recommended. Raw papayas contain a compound called papain, which can cause uterine contractions and can lead to a miscarriage. Additionally, raw papayas can contain harmful bacteria, such as salmonella, which can cause food poisoning. If you want to eat papayas during pregnancy, it is best to make sure they are ripe and cooked. Ripe papayas are safe to eat during pregnancy, as they contain beneficial nutrients such as vitamin C, folate, and potassium. Cooked papayas are also safe to eat during pregnancy, as the heat will kill any harmful bacteria.
